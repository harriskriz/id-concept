## Electromagnetic Awareness

We understand Electromagnetic Noise as a disruptive subset of man-made
Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR), often caused by modern devices. When
uncontrolled, it contributes to Electromagnetic Pollution, affecting
both sensitive electronics and human well-being. Our deep awareness
allows us to design environments that reduce such
interference---promoting reliability, safety, and healthier living
spaces.
